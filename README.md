GoHeroes2
=========

Heroes of Might and Magic II was a popular turn-based strategy released in 1996.

More information: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroes_of_Might_and_Magic_II>

See some gameplay here: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyOrxyypLdA>

GoHeroes2 is a bunch of Go-lang based tools for manipulating the game assets.
In order to use them you must have access to the original game data files.

You can buy the game very cheaply here: <http://www.gog.com/game/heroes_of_might_and_magic_2_gold_edition>.

So far I have only published the asset extractor I wrote.

## Tools
